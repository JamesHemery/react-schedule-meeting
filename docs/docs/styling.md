# Styling

Styled-Components is currently required as a peer dependency but I don't know if that will last forever :shrug: There are a few classNames included on key components such as `rsm-arrow-button`, `rsm-confirm-button`, `rsm-cancel-button`, `rsm-empty-list-text`, `rsm-no-future-times-text`, `rsm-next-available-date-button`, and `rsm-date-title` for _relatively_ easy CSS selection.

The entire schedule component takes into account 2 main styles, borderRadius and primaryColor to try and theme the calendar with very little effort. However, fine-tuning styles is always a nice thing to have so I intend to improve this in the future. Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/TylerAHolden/react-schedule-meeting/labels/enhancement) to let me know how you would prefer to see styling access improvements!
